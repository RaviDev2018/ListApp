# ListApp

This is an application which I am developing for personal development.

The intention of this application is to be able to create lists where you can add list items. A real-world example would be a shopping list where you would have items such as bread and oranges.

I will be using NodeJS to create the backend server and ReactJS to display the user interface.

Please feel free to use my application and if you have any suggestions please let me know.
