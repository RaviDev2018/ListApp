# ListApp
 
Hi, this is an application which I am developing for personal development.
 
The intention on this application is to be able to create lists where you can add list items. A real-world example would be a shopping list where you would have food items, clothes etc. 
 
I will be using the React JavaScript framework along with Firebase for any saving and retrieval of data. In the future I aim to write my own backend code with Java and Spring. 

You can view a live demo here: https://list-app-react.firebaseapp.com
 
Please feel free to use my application and if you have any suggestions please let me know.
